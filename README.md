## ✨ Why Warden?

Most AI apps today are just websites wrapped in a window (Electron). They feel heavy, drain battery, and don't integrate well with macOS.

Warden is different. It's built with 100% native code, making it:

- **Blazing Fast**: Launches instantly, uses minimal RAM (<150MB).
- **Battery Friendly**: Optimized for Apple Silicon efficiency.
- **Truly Private**: Your data never leaves your device (except to your chosen AI provider).

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-Model Support**: Use OpenAI, Anthropic (Claude), Gemini, Perplexity, OpenRouter and more using your own API key.
- **Local AI**: Full support for Ollama and LM Studio.
- **Projects & Workspaces**: Organize chats into projects with colors, descriptions, and project-specific instructions.
- **AI Assistants (Personas)**: Create custom assistants with different roles, tones, and default settings.
- **File & PDF Chat**: Drag & drop files (PDF, CSV, text, and more) and ask questions about what’s inside.
- **Multi-Model Compare (Beta)**: Ask up to 3 models at once, compare responses, then continue with your favorite.
- **Search Capabilities**: Real-time web search integration with citation support.
- **Developer Tools**: Native code execution and syntax highlighting.
- **Tools & Agents**: Toggle tools per message (like web search) and connect optional MCP agents for advanced integrations.
- **Menu Bar Access**: Keep Warden in your menu bar for quick access.
- **Fluid Design**: Animations and interactions that feel right at home on your Mac, including liquid glass support for MacOS 26.
